#Files
`dataset_builder.py` stores a bunch of csv files in a directory called csvs
`combine_csvs.py` combines the different csvs into one csv called `bigboi.csv`
`clean_data.py` does some basic cleaning of the data in `bigboi.csv`

##Disclaimer
This is not a fast script, nor does it claim to be the best way to implement
news harvesting. This script can be easily modified to harvest text from other
webpages by modifying the `urls` and `years` lists around line 13.
